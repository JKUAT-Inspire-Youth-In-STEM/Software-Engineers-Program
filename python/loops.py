# Loops are and essential part of programming. They allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. 
# There are two types of loops in Python, "for" and "while".

# "For" loop
# The "for" loop is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects. 
# Let us iterate over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "pineapple"]

# square brackets are used to define a list [ ]



# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)

print(fruits[0])

# for i in range(10):
#     print(i)

# for i in range(7):
#     print(i)

# for char in "Python":
#     print(char)
